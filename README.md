# Jesse Declercq's Public Repository
This repository embodies the passions and innermost intricasies within my mind. You will clearly see the radical improvement in coding etiquette which we can all confess to. 
I dont see this as falacy, rather as the apex of my growth as a researcher and engineer. 

I am currently persuing my Master's Degree in Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Pretoria here in South Africa.
